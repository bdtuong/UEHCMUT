            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              For over 400 years, the ancient town of Hoi An has been illuminated by the warm glow of traditional
              lanterns. These beautiful creations are more than mere decorations - they are symbols of prosperity, good
              fortune, and the enduring spirit of Vietnamese culture.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Each lantern is meticulously handcrafted by skilled artisans who have inherited techniques passed down
              through generations. The delicate silk fabric, carefully stretched over bamboo frames, creates a soft,
              warm light that has welcomed travelers and locals alike for centuries.

            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              During the full moon festival, thousands of these lanterns float down the Thu Bon River, carrying with
              them the wishes and dreams of the Vietnamese people. This magical tradition continues to this day,
              connecting the modern world with ancient wisdom and timeless beauty.
